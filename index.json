    "keywords": "Deploying Microsoft Syntex Models Microsoft Syntex Models typically are deployed to document libraries across your tenant. This can be done by using the Content Center site, but this can also be done using PnP PowerShell as explained in this article. If you want to work with Microsoft Syntex models via code then check out the Working with Microsoft Syntex support for PnP Core SDK . Listing the available models in a Content Center To get an overview of the models added to the current Microsoft Syntex Content Center site use the Get-PnPSyntexModel cmdlet: Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/yourContentCenter\" Get-PnPSyntexModel Deploying a given model to a library To deploy a model to a library you can use Publish-PnPSyntexModel cmdlet: Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/yourContentCenter\" Publish-PnPSyntexModel -Model \"Contract Notice\" -ListWebUrl \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance\" -List \"Documents\" Above sample deployed the \"Contract Notice\" model a single document library but if you need to deploy a model to many libraries it's more efficient to use to built-in batch feature: Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/yourContentCenter\" # Create a new batch $batch = New-PnPBatch # Add model deployments to the batch Publish-PnPSyntexModel -Model \"Contract Notice\" -TargetSiteUrl \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance\" -TargetWebServerRelativeUrl \"/sites/finance\" -TargetLibraryServerRelativeUrl \"/sites/finance/shared%20documents\" -Batch $batch Publish-PnPSyntexModel -Model \"Contract Notice\" -TargetSiteUrl \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/crm\" -TargetWebServerRelativeUrl \"/sites/crm\" -TargetLibraryServerRelativeUrl \"/sites/crm/shared%20documents\" -Batch $batch Publish-PnPSyntexModel -Model \"Contract Notice\" -TargetSiteUrl \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance\" -TargetWebServerRelativeUrl \"/sites/finance/belgium\" -TargetLibraryServerRelativeUrl \"/sites/finance/belgium/shared%20documents\" -Batch Publish-PnPSyntexModel -Model \"Contract Notice\" -TargetSiteUrl \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance\" -TargetWebServerRelativeUrl \"/sites/finance/uk\" -TargetLibraryServerRelativeUrl \"/sites/finance/uk/shared%20documents\" -Batch $batch # Execute batch Invoke-PnPBatch -Batch $batch Un-publishing a model from a library Un-publishing follows the same pattern as publishing and can be done using the Unpublish-PnPSyntexModel cmdlet either interactively or as batch of multiple un-publish actions. Understanding where a model is used Once you've deployed a model to many libraries you might want to review the list of libraries using your model. This can be done using the Get-PnPSyntexModelPublication cmdlet: Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/yourContentCenter\" Get-PnPSyntexModelPublication -Identity \"Contract Notice\" Processing existing data in a library Imagine the scenario where you've applied a content understanding model to an existing library: from that point on any newly added content is processed via the content understanding model...but existing content is not. To process existing content you can select the file and use the user interface, but you can also use the Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract cmdlet: #Note: you're connecting here to the site that holds the document library you want to process Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance\" Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -List \"Documents\" The above approach will classify all the the files in the site which where never classified by the model, using -force you can get all files processed again. You can also opt to classify file by file: #Note: you're connecting here to the site that holds the document library you want to process Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance\" Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -FileUrl \"/sites/finance/documents/contoso contract.docx\" The file by file model also supports batching: #Note: you're connecting here to the site that holds the document library you want to process Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/finance\" # Create a new batch $batch = New-PnPBatch # Add file classify to the batch Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -FileUrl \"/sites/finance/documents/contoso contract.docx\" -Batch $batch Request-PnPSyntexClassifyAndExtract -FileUrl \"/sites/finance/documents/relecloud contract.docx\" -Batch $batch # Execute batch Invoke-PnPBatch -Batch $batch"

Invoice Review Once the metadata has been captured using Microsoft Syntex and AI Builder, PowerApps will display this information to the user in a clean, easy to use format. Accounts Payable can use this to provide additional accounting information or assign approvers. It can be easily modified to accommodate your business process. Invoice review details Invoice review line items Invoice approval history SharePoint Schema To get things started, we need to configure out content types and SharePoint information architecture to accommodate capturing the invoice ‚Äúheader‚Äù information, typically located at the top that has non-repeating items such as vendor name, invoice number, date due etc. We also need a ‚Äúline items‚Äù list to hold each itemized item that has been purchased. A typical schema should resemble this: Create the following library and list for this solution: Invoices Library Invoice Lines List A few things to keep in mind: There should be a content type created for each list, we‚Äôll need this later when configuring the search experience. It‚Äôs best to do this in the SharePoint Admin Center -> Content Services -> Content Type Gallery and then deploy it to the hub the library/list is in. The relationship between Invoices and Line Items is a 1:many relationship where the InvoiceID column is the SharePoint ID in the Invoices list. Solution Assets The assets for the solution are in the /assets folder. The .zip file contains the Power Platform components while the Invoices.classifier contains the Invoices prebuilt model that can be deployed to your Content Center. Deploy the Power Platform solutions The invoice automation solution has been packed in a Power Platform solution file (/assets .zip file) that has all the components necessary to properly deploy it in your environment. This guide will help you configure it properly. Navigate to Power Automate in your tenant -> Solutions and select the Import button. Select the .zip file that represents the Invoices solution. Once imported you will see a success message. Configure the solution Once the solution has been successfully imported, you will see it in the list of Solutions in Power Automate. Click into the solution and configure the following Environment Variables: SiteCollection ‚Äì select the connection and add the site collection that will contain the Invoices Library and list. Invoice Library ‚Äì Select a connection and the library that will contain the invoice documents. Invoice Lines ‚Äì Select a connection and the list that will contain the invoice line items. Configure the Power App The Power App in the solution has 2 data connections to the Invoices library and Invoice Lines list. Within the solution, Edit the Canvas App Navigate to the Data Connections tab and delete and re-add the data connections to the Invoices and Invoice Lines objects in SharePoint. Save and test the app to ensure it‚Äôs retrieving the invoice and lines information. Import the Invoices Syntex Model The pre-built invoices model in Syntex is used to process the header information of the invoice. The .classifier file should be uploaded to your Syntex content center and then deployed to the Invoices document library."

    "keywords": "Unstructured Document Processing and Content Assembly App In this scenario you will find a Power Platform sample document management solution that uses Microsoft Syntex Unstructured Document Processing and Content Assembly. All from a Power App: upload a benefits changes document to the app and a Syntex document understanding model will process the document and will extract metadata values from the document. Then using the extracted metadata with Syntex content assembly a custom service agreement will be generated and made available in the app. Deploy today to your tenant and see a great example of the art of the possible with Power Platform and Microsoft Syntex. Sample/Source Code You can find the sample source code here: /scenario-samples/Unstructured-DPM-and-CA-Scenario Deployment Instructions Currently most of the steps are manual (for example import the content assembly modern template) but hopefully in the near future it might be possible to automate all of the process using MS Graph API or new Powershell commands. Before starting, download all content in a single folder on your computer. Then use the PnP PowerShell powered scripts to deploy the necessary SharePoint online libraries, columns and the Syntex model to your content center. Import Syntex Model \"BenefitChangesServiceAgreement.pnp\" into your Syntex content center Import Syntex model into your Syntex Content Center Import Syntex Model into your Syntex content center The first step is to import the Syntex model template named BenefitChangesServiceAgreement.pnp into your Syntex Content Center. To do this run ImportSyntexModel.ps1 PowerShell script. Before running the PowerShell script open the file with your preferred editor and update: Variable $ContentCenterURL to be the url of your Syntex content center. Save and execute the script. After this you will find in your Syntex content center that the new model has been deployed. Create SharePoint libraries, columns and deploy Syntex model Ensure a new SharePoint site (recommended template Team Site) is created or an existing site can be reused for this solution. Make a note of the URL for this site. The next step is to create the necessary SharePoint libraries, columns and publish the Syntex model to a library. To do this use the DeployContent.ps1 PowerShell script. Before running the PowerShell script open the file with your preferred editor and update: Variable $SiteURL to be url of the site to be used to add files and create documents. Variable $ContentCenterURL to be the url of your Syntex content center. Optionally update the variables $LibraryNameSA and $LibraryNameCA to use different library names Save and execute the script. The script completes the following: Creates the Contract Management Hub document library Add ServiceAgreementLink column to library Create Service Agreement document library Publishes the Syntex model to Contract Management Hub document library Create Modern Template in \"Service Agreement\" document library The next step is to create the Syntex Content Assembly modern template. Currently these are manual steps and the instructions are added below. 1. Create Modern Template Access the ‚ÄúService Agreement‚Äù document library in your target site. Select \"+ New\" -> \"Create Modern Template\" 2. Select ‚ÄúService Agreement Contract.docx‚Äù as Template 3. Create Placeholders You need to create 3 placeholders in your template Employee Name Change Date Discount This will be the final result: To complete the above - do the following... Create ‚ÄúEmployee Name‚Äù field. Click on ‚Äú+ New field‚Äù As Name type ‚ÄúEmployee Name‚Äù Select ‚ÄúEnrico Cattaneo‚Äù in the document text and ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù Press ‚ÄúNext‚Äù button Select ‚ÄúSingle line of text‚Äù and press ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button Click ‚Äú+ New field‚Äù to create ‚ÄúChange Date‚Äù field Select ‚ÄúSeptember 15, 2017‚Äù in document text. Press ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù button‚Ä¶ Select ‚ÄúDate and time‚Äù as type Press ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button‚Ä¶ Click ‚Äú+ New field‚Äù to create ‚ÄúDiscount‚Äù field Select ‚Äú8‚Äù in document text. Press ‚ÄúConfirm‚Äù button‚Ä¶ Select ‚ÄúNumber‚Äù as type 4. Publish Template Press ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù button in the top right hand corner to publish the template. Do not change the template name and press the ‚ÄúPublish‚Äù button one more time. 5. Check Result Now check that the ‚ÄúService Agreement Contract‚Äù template is now available in ‚ÄúService Agreement‚Äù document library Import Power Platform Solution In this step you need to import DocManagementMicrosoftSyntex_1_0_0_9.zip as solution in your Power Platform Environment. To do this remember that you need an Environment with Dataverse. 1. Import Solution Go to the Power Platform admin centre & under the ‚ÄúSolution‚Äù section, click ‚ÄúImport Solution‚Äù 2. Select ‚ÄúDocManagementMicrosoftSyntex_1_0_0_8.zip‚Äù Select zip file and click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù Import this solution as ‚ÄúUnmanaged‚Äù because you will need to change some settings and configuration after the import 3. Configuring SharePoint settings (connection and url) Now you must select a valid SharePoint connection. If you don‚Äôt have a valid connection the wizard will help you to create a SPO connection Click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù Now you are able to select the correct SharePoint site URL and the ‚ÄúContract Management Hub‚Äù document library Click ‚ÄúImport‚Äù Wait the process finish to import the solution. Modify Environment Variables Click on Solution to see all details 1. Modify ‚ÄúSharePointSiteURL‚Äù variable Edit the environment variable ‚ÄúSharePointSiteURL‚Äù Under ‚ÄúCurrent Site Value‚Äù click on ‚Äú+ Add existing‚Äù Select SPO target site for deployment Press ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button. 2. Modify ‚ÄúContract Management Library Name‚Äù variable Edit the environment variable \"Contract Management Library Name\" Under ‚ÄúCurrent List Value‚Äù section click on ‚Äú+ Add existing‚Äù Select ‚ÄúContact Management Hub‚Äù and click ‚ÄúSave‚Äù Modify ‚ÄúGenerateServiceAgreement‚Äù flow Edit the flow \"GenerateServiceAgreement\" in ‚ÄúNew Tab‚Äù This is the flow... 1. Modify action ‚ÄúGenerate document using SharePoint Syntex (preview)‚Äù Because you have created the ‚ÄúModern Template‚Äù manually you must change the reference in this action Clear ‚ÄúDocument Template‚Äù field. Clear ‚ÄúDocument Library‚Äù field Now PowerAutomate enables you to set the correct values In ‚ÄúDocument Library Name‚Äù field select ‚ÄúService Agreement‚Äù In ‚ÄúDocument Template‚Äù field select ‚ÄúService Agreement Contract‚Äù 2. Change all the field references Now you must change the field references First you remove ‚Äúitem/xxxx‚Äù values, after this add the correct values to the fields Change Date -> Change Date Discount -> Change Fee Employee Name -> Employee Name Save the flow. 3. Check flow is ‚ÄúTurned on‚Äù If the flow is ‚ÄúTurn off‚Äù enable it using ‚ÄúTurn On‚Äù button Test the app Now you are ready to test the Power App and Flows that simulate a document management process. 1. Play ‚ÄúManageDocument‚Äù App 2. Click on ‚ÄúAttach file‚Äù and select ‚ÄúContract_Change_WWI_4.docx‚Äù 3.
